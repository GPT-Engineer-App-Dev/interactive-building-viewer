I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI text-based model, I'm unable to create image files or any other type of binary files. However, I can guide you through the process of creating a map pin icon using a graphic design software or provide you with a description of how it should look.

If you want to create the icon yourself, you can use software like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or free alternatives like GIMP or Inkscape. Here's a simple guide on how you could create a map pin icon:

1. Open your graphic design software and create a new document with the desired dimensions for your icon, for example, 64x64 pixels.

2. Use the shape tool to draw a circle that will form the rounded body of the pin. Fill it with a color that will stand out on the map, such as red or blue.

3. Draw a rectangle beneath the circle, aligning it to the center. This will form the pin's tail.

4. Use the pen tool or a similar tool to create a sharp point at the bottom of the rectangle, completing the pin's tail.

5. Merge the circle and the pointed tail shape to create a single pin shape.

6. Optionally, add a white circle or another shape inside the rounded body of the pin to represent the pin's reflection or shine, giving it a more three-dimensional look.

7. Save your icon as a PNG file with a transparent background to ensure it can be placed over any map background without a white box around it.

Remember, this is just a text description, and you would need to use actual graphic design software to create the image file. If you need a visual representation, you would need to find or create the image using the appropriate tools or services.
